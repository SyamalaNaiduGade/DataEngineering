# 📦 Data Engineering Repository

Welcome to the **Data Engineering** repository — a complete, hands-on learning and practice guide for mastering data engineering skills from scratch to advanced. This repository is organized as a roadmap, broken into core topics every Data Engineer should learn, with detailed examples, best practices, and real-world use cases.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured into five main steps. Each folder contains topic-wise subfolders, practice files, real data scenarios, and relevant documentation.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### ✅ Step 1: SQL
Master SQL fundamentals and advanced concepts with examples.
- `Basic_Syntax`: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.
- `DDL_DML_DCL`: Create, Insert, Update, Delete, Permissions.
- `Joins_Subqueries`: INNER, OUTER, CROSS, correlated subqueries.
- `Views_Indexes`: How and when to use indexes, create views.
- `CTEs_WindowFunctions`: Ranking, aggregates, running totals, and more.
- `DimensionalModeling`: Includes Star and Snowflake schema examples, ERDs, and sample data.

### 🐍 Step 2: Python
Build data manipulation and analysis skills.
- `Fundamentals`: Variables, loops, functions.
- `NumPy`: Arrays and vectorized operations.
- `Pandas`: DataFrames, filtering, groupby, joins, and real-world tasks.

### 🔥 Step 3: PySpark
Learn big data processing with Spark.
- `RDD`: Low-level data transformations and actions.
- `DataFrame`: Modern Spark APIs for structured data.
- `Datasets`: Strongly typed APIs.
- `SparkStreaming`: Real-time data ingestion and processing.
- `Optimization`: Partitioning, caching, broadcasting, etc.

### 🗃️ Step 4: Data Warehousing / Modeling
Understand how to model and store data efficiently.
- `OLAP_vs_OLTP`: Differences and use-cases.
- `Fact_DimensionTables`: Identify and design dimensions/facts.
- `SCD_Types`: Handle historical data (Type 1, 2, 3).
- `Real_World_Cases`: Healthcare, Retail, Finance examples.

### ☁️ Step 5: Cloud Services
Implement cloud-native solutions.
- `NoSQL_vs_Relational`: MongoDB, Cassandra vs PostgreSQL, MySQL.
- `DataWarehousing`: BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse.
- `Orchestration_Scheduling`: Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory.
- `Messaging`: Kafka, Pub/Sub, Event Grid.
- `ETL_Tools`: Glue, Dataflow, Talend.
- `Storage`: Blob, S3, Data Lake.
- `DataProcessing`: Databricks, EMR, Spark on Cloud.
